# go-design-patterns

This repository demonstrates various design patterns implemented in the Go programming language.

These examples serve as a learning resource for developers looking to better understand how design patterns can be applied in the language.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding new patterns or improving existing examples.

### Introduction

Design patterns are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems that arise in software design. They provide a template or guide for solving these problems in a flexible and reusable way.

Each pattern represents a best practice that developers can adapt to their specific context. Design patterns are often classified into three main categories.

### Main Categories

1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation.

   - **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
   - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
   - **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Focus on object composition.

   - **Adapter**: Makes incompatible interfaces work together.
   - **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
   - **Facade**: Simplifies complex interfaces.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on communication between objects.
   - **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects of state changes.
   - **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors.
   - **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects.

### Why Use Design Patterns?

- Reusability: Patterns provide tested solutions that can be reused across projects.

- Efficiency: Using patterns can save time and effort in problem-solving.

- Maintainability: Code structured with patterns is often easier to maintain and modify.

- Scalability: Many patterns are designed to handle growing system complexity.

- Communication: Design patterns provide a common language for developers to discuss solutions.
